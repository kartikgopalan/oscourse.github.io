<h1>Parallel Bubble Sort Using Multiple Processes</h1>

<h2> Goal </h2>
In this assignment, you will implement a parallel version of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a bunch of numbers using multiple processes.
You will learn about working with multiple processes, concurrency, race conditions, and simple inter-process synchronization. 

<h2> Part A: Sequential Bubble Sort</h2>
<ol>
<li> Study, compile, and run <a href=seq_bubble.c>this sequential bubble sort program</a>.
It takes an integer argument N, 
generates a set of N random integers, 
sorts them in ascending order using bubble sort, and 
prints the sorted list to standard output.
<pre>
$ seq_bubble 4
Generating.
20 10 15 2
Sorted sequence is as follows:
2 10 15 20
</pre>
</li>

<li> Now study, compile, and run <a href=even_odd_bubble.c>this even-odd pass variant of sequential bubble sort</a>. You will find this version more amenable to a parallel implementation.

<li> Test the above programs with hundreds, thousands, or millions of numbers. Adjust MAX_NUM and MAX_COUNT in the code as needed. 

<li> You can redirect very large output to a file using the <tt>&gt</tt> operator to examine later.

<li> Use <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> to measure and print the sorting time for different values of N.

</ol>

<h2> Part B: Parallel Bubble Sort</h2>
<p> Now, implement a parallel version of the even-odd bubble sort.
<ul>
<li> Besides N, the parallel bubble sort should take an additional argument P, representing the number of 
concurrent worker processes (not threads). 
For example, for N=100 and P=5,
<pre>
$ parallel_bubble 100 5 
</pre>

<li> The initial (parent) process creates a shared memory segment in which it stores an array of N random integers. 
<li> Next, the parent process forks P worker processes. After <tt>fork</tt>, each worker process inherits the attached shared memory segment that was created by the parent.
<li> Each worker process should execute the parallel bubble sort operation on (about equal sized) overlapping segments of the array, as explained in <a href=bubble_sort.pdf>the slides</a>.
<li> Each worker should use a barrier (busy looping for now) to coordinate with ''neighboring'' workers at the end of each pass.
<li> You can also store any additional data in the shared memory that's needed for inter-worker synchronization.
<li> The parent prints out the fully sorted array once all workers processes have finished.
<li> Is your parallel version faster or slower than the sequential version? Time it using <tt>gettimeofday()</tt>. Think about how to make a fair comparison.
</ul>


<h2> You will need to learn learn the following concepts:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href=bubble_sort.pdf>bubble sort algorithm.</a>
	<li><tt>fork()</tt> system call
	<li><tt>pipe()</tt> system call
	<li><tt>shmget()</tt>, <tt>shmat()</tt>, <tt>shmdt()</tt>, and <tt>shmctl()</tt> system calls.
	<li><tt>gettimeofday()</tt> to time the sorting performance.
</ul>

<h2> Requirements </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Use only the C language and glibc, so that you can understand low-level behavior or your code. No other languages, libraries or packages are necessary. </li>
	<li> Do not use any pre-existing bubble-sort implementations/libraries other than the ones provided in this assignment.
	<li> Implement only a parallel version of bubble sort, NOT any other sorting algorithm, even though there may be other (possibly better)  parallel sorting algorithms, such as parallel merge sort. 
	<li> Use only multiple processes, not threads. 
</ul>

<h2> Grading Guideline </h2>
