<H1> Named Pipe for Exchanging Lines </H1>


<H2>Objective</H2>
You will implement a kernel-level pipe for exchanging numbers among user-level processes.
You will learn about concurrency, synchronization, and various kernel primitives.
You may find the following resources helpful in addition to any other online resources.

<H2>Task A</H2>
Learn what is a named pipe.
Learn how to create and use a named pipe using command line in Linux (or any UNIX system) using the <tt>mkfifo</tt> command.

<a name=taskb></a>
<H2> Task B </H2>
Read, understand, and run, following two user-level C-programs for a consumer and a producer.
<!-- (adapted from code in this <a href=http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/using-named-pipes-fifos-bash>link</a>).-->
<ul>
<li> <a href=assignments/consumer_numbers.c>Consumer C program</a> 
<li> <a href=assignments/producer_numbers.c>Producer C program</a> 
<li> Run one consumer and one producer concurrently.
<ul>
	<li> Kill the producer with Ctrl-C. Leave consumer running.  What happens and why?
	<li> Kill the consumer with Ctrl-C. Leave producer running.  What happens and why?
</ul>
<li> Run one consumer and multiple producers concurrently. 
<li> Run multiple consumers and one producer concurrently. 
<li> Run multiple consumers and multiple producers concurrently. 
</ul>
Explain in your report, what you see, and why.

<H2> Task C </H2>
Now solve the problem you observed in Task B as follows.
Replace the UNIX named pipe in the producer and consumer scripts above with 
your own implementation of a miscellaneous character device (say /dev/numpipe)
as a kernel module in the Linux Kernel. 
This device must maintain a FIFO queue (i.e. a pipe) of maximum N numbers. N must be given as a module parameter during the insmod command.
<ul>
<li> Producers write numbers to /dev/numpipe.
<li> Consumers read numbers from /dev/numpipe and print it on the screen.
<li> When the pipe is full, i.e. when there are N numbers are stored in /dev/numpipe, then any producer trying to write will block.
<li> When the pipe is empty, i.e. when there are no numbers in /dev/numpipe, then any consumer trying to read will block.
<li> When a consumer reads from a full pipe, it wakes up all blocked producers. In this case, no blocked consumer should be woken up.
<li> When a producer writes to an empty pipe, it wakes up all blocked consumers. In this case, no blocked producer should be woken up.
<li> No deadlocks. All producers and consumers make progress as long as at least one of each is running.
<li> No race conditions. Each number that is written by producers is read EXACTLY once by one consumer. No number is lost. No number is read more than once. 
</ul>

<H2>What you need to learn to complete this assignment</h2>
You can use either the semaphore-version of the solution to producer-consumer problem or a monitor-type solution, both of which were covered in class.
It is likely the semaphore version may be easier to implement.
You will need to learn the following kernel mechanisms.
<ul>
<li>Using semaphores in kernel using the following functions: sema_init(), DEFINE_SEMAPHORE, down_interruptible() (preferred over down()), and up().
<li>For alternative implementations using mutexes and waitqs: mutex_init(), DEFINE_MUTEX, mutex_lock(), mutex_unlock(), init_wait_queue_head(), wait_event_interruptible() (preferred over wait_event), and wake_up_interruptible() (or wake_up).
<li>Memory allocation in kernel using kmalloc() or kzalloc().
</ul>

<H2> Frequently asked questions </H2>
<P>
Q: Is there any locking in user space for Part C? 
<br>
A: No, all synchronization happens in kernel space.

<P>
Q: Do we implement our own producers and consumers in user space?
<br>
A: No, use the two C programs given above. 

<p>
Q: How to I terminate producers and consumers?
<br>
A: After fixed number of iterations OR using Ctrl-C.

<p> 
Q: Why should I use *_interruptible versions of kernel functions?
<br>
A: So that your producer/consumer code can be terminated using Ctrl-C in user space. We'll test for this during demo.

<p>
Q: How does the producer generate a unique number? 
<br>
A: Please see C programs above. 

<p>
Q: How to I run multiple producers and consumers concurrently?
<br>
A: Open multiple terminals. Run one consumer or producer in the foreground each terminal.
