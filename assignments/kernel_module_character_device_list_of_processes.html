<h2> Accessing your Virtual Machines</h2>
<p> <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4XSvTLoq3S13eOPyDe63EpB5YjD80N5eoI4qcpCr-8/edit?usp=sharing>Instructions to access your virtual machine remotely</a>
<p> This assignment will be carried out on a Linux virtual machine. Each student has been assigned a VM with a unique IP address. 
The login credentials have been emailed to you. 
You can either use the VM assigned to you or you can use your own Linux VM on your personal computer.

<h2>TASK 1: Learn how to write and execute a Linux kernel module. </h2>
<p>Kernel modules allow code to be dynamically added to a running kernel. 

	<li> Study the kernel modules <a href=https://oscourse.github.io/examples/module/>hello.c and hellon.c</a>. 
	They have initialization and cleanup functions that are invoked upon loading and unloading the kernel modules. 
	The module hellon.c is similar to hello.c, except that it takes command-line arguments during insertion.

	<li> Compile the kernel module:
		<pre>make</pre>

	<li> Load the kernel module:
		<pre>sudo insmod hello.ko</pre>
		<p>If the module was successfully inserted, you will see the message "mymodule: Hello World!" in the kernel console. Use commands "dmesg" or "tail-n 20 /var/log/syslog" to see the kernel log messages.</p>

	<li> Unload the kernel module:
		<pre>sudo rmmod hello</pre>
		<p>Upon removing the kernel module, use the "dmesg" command to check if kernel log prints the message "mymodule: Goodbye, cruel world!!"</p>

	<li> For hellon.c, module insertion command is <tt>sudo insmod hellon.ko whom=class howmany=10</tt> (or any other argument values you want). Removal is the same as for hello.c.

<H1>Kernel Modules and Character Device to list all processes</H1>
</CENTER>

<OL>

<LI>
	<P> Implement a kernel module that
	creates a <tt>/dev/process_list</tt> character device.
	The character device should support the <tt>read()</tt> operation. 
	When the <tt>read()</tt> system call is invoked on your character device from a user space process,
	your kernel module should return to the following information for 
	all currently running processes:
	<ol>
	<li> process ID 
	<li> parent process ID 
	<li> the CPU on which the process is running
	<li> its current state.
	</ol>

	For example, the output could be as follows:

	<pre>
	PID=1 PPID=0 CPU=4 STATE=TASK_RUNNING
	PID=2 PPID=0 CPU=2 STATE=TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
	PID=10 PPID=2 CPU=0 STATE=TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	PID=16434 PPID=16424 CPU=10 STATE=TASK_DEAD
	PID=14820 PPID=16424 CPU=8 STATE=TASK_WAKEKILL,TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
	...and so forth
	</pre>

	<p>Note that the <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L638>state</a> field in  <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L629>task_struct</a> can be -1, 0 or greater than 0.  A state value of 1 or more indicates a combination (bitwise OR) 
<a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/sched.h#L75>
values listed here.
</a>

	<p>So you will have to parse the <tt>task-->state</tt> value to figure out which of the states apply to a process. You can pass the raw state value (as a <tt>long</tt> value) from kernel to user space and decode the state values in your user space program.

</LI>

<LI>
Also, provide a user-space C program that open your  character device and outputs the list of processes retrieved from your character device.

<p>
One such application could be written as follows (please fill in the missing code):

<pre>
char *buffer;

/* allocate memory for character buffers HERE before you use them */

fd = open("/dev/process_list", O_RDONLY);
/* check for errors HERE */

while(!some termination condition)
{
	bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, buffer_length);
	/* check for errors HERE. Exit loop if all processes have been retrieved. */
	/* print the output you have read so far. */
}

close(fd);
</pre>

</LI>
</OL>

<!--
<H2>Part B: Character Device to list ready processes for each CPU</H2>
<P> Write another kernel module that creates a character device <tt>/dev/runq_list</tt> and its corresponding user space code
that retrieves the list of processes currently in the <b>ready queue of each CPU</b>. 
In your output, group processes by the CPU on which they are running.</LI>
-->


<P>BEWARE that bugs in kernel code may either crash your kernel immediately 
or may have no immediate
visible effect, but may have a delayed effect that is disastrous.
Therefore, you cannot assume that the thing
you did most recently is necessarily the cause of a crash.</P>

<H2>Grading Guidelines</H2>

<pre>
	Kernel Module- 60
	User-level code - 30
	Error checks and coding style - 10

	Total = 100
</pre>

	Chapters 1 and 2 of the following online book provide a good introduction
	to the kernel, though with a bias towards device-driver development.
