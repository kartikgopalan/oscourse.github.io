<H1> Assignment: Tracking Page Faults for a Process</H1>

<H2>
Objective 
</H2>
<p> You will learn how to use kernel-level probing mechanisms to intercept and track kernel events, here specifically page-faults for a specific process.

<H2> 
Description
</H2>

<p> Kprobes enables you to dynamically set a breakpoint in any kernel routine and
collect debugging and performance information non-disruptively. You
can trap at almost any kernel code address, specifying a handler
routine to be invoked when the breakpoint is hit.

<ol>

<li> 
Learn how to use kprobes in the Linux kernel.
<a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kprobes.txt> 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kprobes.txt
</a>

<li>
Try these example kernel modules for practice:
<a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/samples/kprobes>
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/samples/kprobes
</a>

<li>
Study the 
<a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L4191>
handle_mm_fault()
</a>
function in the Linux kernel to 
understand when it is invoked and what it does.

<li> Part A:
Now create a kernel module that takes the process-ID of an active process as 
an argument (either module parameter or via an ioctl interface), and tracks 
all the virtual addresses on which the target process faults.
Print the virtual addresses to the system log using printk().
Show that your code works for any arbitrary target process.

<li> Part B:
Plot the virtual addresses you tracked as a scatter-plot graph with X-axis 
representing the time and Y-axis representing the virtual address.
Try at least three different types of target applications, such as 
kernel compilation (compute and I/O intensive),
sysbench (compute intensive), iperf (network I/O intensive), or some other applications.
See if you can observe any interesting trends in memory access patterns
of a process.
Describe your results in a concise report.

<li> Bonus Section: (optional)
Store the tracked virtual addresses and the time at
which each address was trapped in a kernel buffer, possibly a circular array.
Retrieve the buffer from user space using an <a href=https://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.4/html/x856.html>ioctl()</a> interface.
<!-- or a <a href=https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html>/proc</a> interface. -->
