<b>Academic Integrity: Please read carefully.</b>
<ul>
	<li>"Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching." - C.S. Lewis
<!--
<li>What is Integrity/Character?
	<ul>
	<li>"The true test of a person's character is what one does when no one is watching." - John Wooden
	<li>"Character is not only doing the right thing when no one is looking, it's doing the right thing when everyone is looking. It's being willing to do the right thing even when it costs more than you want to pay." - Michael Josephson
	<li>"Champions are made when no one is watching" - Unknown
	</ul>
-->
<li>What is Cheating in this course?
	<ul>
	<li>Submitting work that you have not completed yourself.
	<li>Helping other students complete work that they have not done themselves.
	<li>Signing attendance for your classmates who are not present in class.
	</ul>
<li>Academic Integrity Policies:
	<ul>
	<li><a href=CSHonestyLetterToStudents.pdf>Letter from CS faculty to students</a>, which explains why Academic Honesty is taken seriously in our department and the University.
	<li><a href=http://www.binghamton.edu/watson/about/honesty-policy.pdf>Watson Engineering School's Academic Honesty Code</a>, which explains what is considered cheating and the consequences of cheating.
	<li><a href="http://www.binghamton.edu:8080/exist/rest/bulletin/2018-2019/xq/02_acad_policies_procedures_all_students.xq">University's Student Academic Honesty Code</a> 
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Your responsibility:
	<ul>
	<li>Do your own work. 
	<li>Don't do others' work.
	<li>Don't ask/give solutions, including code.
	<li>Don't copy code or any other material from the Internet.
	<li>Protect your code: Change permissions of your work directory to 0700 (chmod 0700 &lt;directory>;).
	<li>When you are stuck or don't understand something, ask the instructor or TA for help.
	<li>It is better to submit your own partially working code (and get partial credit), than to submit someone else's perfectly working code (and get an F).
	<li>Ask the instructor <b>before</b> you collaborate on anything.
	<li>Tell the instructor/TA if you observe cheating in the class.
	<li>Use your common sense: if it doesn't feel right, its probably cheating.
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Our responsibility:
	<ul>
	<li>We will emphasize the value of academic integrity regularly in this course.
	<li>We will conduct individual interviews to have you to explain any work that you submit. Grades will be based on both the submitted work and satisfactory explanation during the interview.
	<li>We will use <a href=http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/>Moss</a>, a tool for detecting plagiarism in programs. It is highly effective at detecting similarity in the logical structure of any two pieces of code, even if variable names, formatting, or comments have been changed.
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences of cheating: 
	<ul>
	<li>Cheating can lead to an F grade in the assignment, test, or the even the entire course. 
	<li>We will forward convincing evidence of cheating to the Watson Dean's office, which may note the incident in the student's records and/or take disciplinary actions. Please read the Watson School policy linked above for detailed consequences of cheating.
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Sickness:</b>
<!-- <b>Please do not attend lecture or lab if you have a fever, body aches, cough, sore throat, or any contagious illness</b>. -->
For regular lectures/labs, you will not be asked to validate your illness with a note from a medical professional. Missing an assignment deadline or a scheduled exam due to illness still requires medical documentation. It is considered a violation of the academic honesty code if you abuse this policy for non-medical reasons.    
 
<p><b>Attendance:</b>
There is a strong correlation between regular attendance and good grades.
We will use attendance regularity as one of the factors in deciding borderline grades at the end of the course. 

<p>
<b>Announcements:</b>
Announcements will be made either in the class OR through emails.
Missing any announcement due to not attending the class or not checking the emails
is not a valid reason for missed work or examination.

<p>
<b>Makeup exams:</b>
Makeup exam will be given only for medical emergencies or jury duty or according to <a href=https://www.binghamton.edu/cbasm/classroom-scheduling/final-exam-scheduling.html>university's final exam policy</a>, when accompanied with valid documentation. Please DO NOT ask for exceptions to this policy, such as for travel or interviews.

<p>
<b>Late Assignment Submission:</b>
10% penalty off total score for each 24 hours that your assignment is late. That means:
Less than 24 hours late - 10% penalty.
24 to 48 hours late - 20% penalty.
and so forth till the score reaches 0.

<p>
<b>Incomplete Grades (grade of 'I'):</b>
The grade of 'I' will not be given, except if the final exam is missed due to a medical emergency or jury duty, accompanied by valid documentation. In this case, the final exam must be made up before the beginning of the following semester.

<p>
<b>Grade Changes:</b>
Grade on an assignment, quiz, or exam will not be changed unless
there is a grading error on part of the instructor or the TA. 
Extra credit work will not be offered to raise individual grades.
